# elasticsearch-exercise
An  exercise to demonstrate standing up Elasasticsearch in AWS

Will be documenting as I go along, so this may seem a bit like a train of thought.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AK123'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='abc123'
```

```
pip2 install ansible
pip2 install PassLib
pip2 install bcrypt
pip2 install aws
```
